# Allow

The `allow` macro is used to suppress warnings.


## Examples

### Dead Code

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    // This will trigger a warning because `x` is never used.
    // We can suppress it with `allow(dead_code)`.
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    let y = 43;
}
```

### Unused Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    // This will trigger a warning because `x` is never used.
    // We can suppress it with `allow(unused_variables)`.
    #[allow(unused_variables)]
    let y = 43;
}
```

### Unused Imports

```rust
// This will trigger a warning because `std::io::Write` is never used.
// We can suppress it with `allow(unused_imports)`.
#[allow(unused_imports)]
use std::io::Write;
```
