# Vim Visual Mode

## Visual Block

`ctrl-v` to enter visual block mode. You can then use `j` and `k` to select
`shift-i` to insert text at the beginning of the selected block.
`esc` to exit visual block mode.

ex: add 1. in front of each line

```bash
1. first
1. two
1. third
```

```bash
ls
```

```python
print([x**2 for x in range(10)])
```
