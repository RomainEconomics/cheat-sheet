# Concurrency / Parallelism

- **Concurrency** is about managing multiple tasks so they can make progress independently.
- **Parallelism**, however, involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously across multiple resources.

While concurrency focuses on software design for task coordination and can work with or without multiple cores, parallelism relies on hardware to achieve true simultaneous execution, and the two can combine when a concurrent system leverages parallel resources for efficiency.
