# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Implementation in Python

Djikstra's: not guaranteed to work when there are negative edges
Bellman-Ford: will not give the correct answer if there is a negative cycle but works with negative edges
Any negative cycle: the answer is always -infinity as you can just go through the negative cycle infinitely for an infinitely short distance

So before solving any shortest path problem, you can check all edges for negative values, and run a dfs for cycle detection and check if the cycle edges sum up to a negative value to figure out what case you're in

## Pseudocode

The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, even with negative edge weights.

```
function BellmanFord(graph, source):
    // Initialize distances
    distance[source] = 0
    for all other vertices v:
        distance[v] = infinity

    // Relax edges repeatedly
    for i from 1 to |V|-1:  // |V| is the number of vertices
        for each edge (u, v) with weight w:
            if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
                distance[v] = distance[u] + w

    // Check for negative weight cycles
    for each edge (u, v) with weight w:
        if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
            return "Graph contains a negative weight cycle"

    return distance
```

## Basic Implementation

```python
def bellman_ford(graph, source):
    # Step 1: Initialize distances from source to all other vertices as INFINITY
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[source] = 0

    # Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times
    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for u in graph:
            for v, weight in graph[u].items():
                if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + weight

    # Step 3: Check for negative-weight cycles
    for u in graph:
        for v, weight in graph[u].items():
            if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
                return None

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': -1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'E': 2},
    'C': {},
    'D': {'B': 1, 'C': 5},
    'E': {'D': -3}
}

print(bellman_ford(graph, 'A'))
```

## Variations and Use Cases

### 1. Path Reconstruction Variation

This variation not only finds the shortest distances but also tracks the predecessor of each vertex.

```python
def bellman_ford_with_path(graph, source):
    # Initialize distances and predecessors
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    predecessors = {vertex: None for vertex in graph}
    distances[source] = 0

    # Relax edges
    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for u in graph:
            for v, weight in graph[u].items():
                if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                    predecessors[v] = u

    # Check for negative cycles
    for u in graph:
        for v, weight in graph[u].items():
            if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
                return None, None

    return distances, predecessors

def reconstruct_path(predecessors, target):
    path = []
    current = target
    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = predecessors[current]
    return path[::-1]  # Reverse to get path from source to target

# Example usage
distances, predecessors = bellman_ford_with_path(graph, 'A')
if distances:
    print(f"Path to E: {reconstruct_path(predecessors, 'E')}")
```

### 2. Early Termination Optimization

This variation stops when no relaxation occurs in an iteration, indicating we've found the shortest paths.

```python
def optimized_bellman_ford(graph, source):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[source] = 0

    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        no_changes = True
        for u in graph:
            for v, weight in graph[u].items():
                if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                    no_changes = False

        # If no relaxation occurred in this iteration, we can terminate early
        if no_changes:
            break

    # Check for negative cycles
    for u in graph:
        for v, weight in graph[u].items():
            if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
                return None

    return distances
```

### 3. SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm)

A queue-based optimization of Bellman-Ford that often performs better in practice.

```python
from collections import deque

def spfa(graph, source):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[source] = 0

    # Track vertices in queue
    in_queue = {vertex: False for vertex in graph}
    queue = deque([source])
    in_queue[source] = True

    # Track number of times a vertex is processed
    count = {vertex: 0 for vertex in graph}

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        in_queue[u] = False

        for v, weight in graph[u].items():
            if distances[u] != float('infinity') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + weight

                # If v is not in queue, add it
                if not in_queue[v]:
                    queue.append(v)
                    in_queue[v] = True
                    count[v] += 1

                    # If v has been processed more than |V| times, negative cycle exists
                    if count[v] >= len(graph):
                        print("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
                        return None

    return distances
```

## Use Cases

1. **Network Routing**: Finding the shortest paths in a network where edge weights represent costs, distances, or times.

2. **Currency Exchange**: Detecting arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange networks (negative cycle detection).

3. **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Modeling traffic networks where edge weights represent travel times.

4. **Maximum Flow Problems**: As a component in solving more complex network flow problems.

5. **Circuit Design**: Finding critical paths in circuit designs with timing constraints.

The key advantages of Bellman-Ford over Dijkstra's algorithm:

- Handles negative edge weights
- Detects negative cycles
- Simpler implementation for dense graphs

The main disadvantage is its time complexity of O(|V|Â·|E|), which is worse than Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs without negative edges.

# Bellman-Ford Algorithm in Financial Applications

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is particularly valuable in financial contexts due to its ability to handle negative weights and detect negative cycles. Here are practical examples of using this algorithm with financial data:

## 1. Currency Arbitrage Detection

Currency arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits price differences between different forex markets. The Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect profitable arbitrage opportunities by finding negative cycles in a currency exchange graph.

```python
import math

def detect_arbitrage(exchange_rates):
    """
    Detect arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange rates

    Args:
        exchange_rates: Dictionary mapping currency pairs to exchange rates
                       e.g., {'USD-EUR': 0.85, 'EUR-GBP': 0.9, 'GBP-USD': 1.3}

    Returns:
        List representing an arbitrage cycle, if one exists
    """
    # Extract unique currencies
    currencies = set()
    for pair in exchange_rates:
        currencies.update(pair.split('-'))
    currencies = list(currencies)

    # Build graph: convert exchange rates to negative log values
    # This transforms the multiplication problem into an addition problem
    # and lets us use Bellman-Ford to find negative cycles
    graph = {currency: {} for currency in currencies}
    for pair, rate in exchange_rates.items():
        base, quote = pair.split('-')
        # Use negative log to find arbitrage opportunities
        graph[base][quote] = -math.log(rate)

    # Run Bellman-Ford from an arbitrary source
    source = currencies[0]
    distances = {currency: float('infinity') for currency in currencies}
    predecessors = {currency: None for currency in currencies}
    distances[source] = 0

    # Relax edges |V| - 1 times
    for _ in range(len(currencies) - 1):
        for base in currencies:
            for quote, weight in graph.get(base, {}).items():
                if distances[base] + weight < distances[quote]:
                    distances[quote] = distances[base] + weight
                    predecessors[quote] = base

    # Check for negative cycles
    for base in currencies:
        for quote, weight in graph.get(base, {}).items():
            if distances[base] + weight < distances[quote]:
                # Negative cycle exists, extract it
                cycle = []
                current = base
                visited = set()

                while current not in visited:
                    visited.add(current)
                    cycle.append(current)
                    current = predecessors[current]

                # Complete the cycle
                cycle.append(current)
                # Get the cycle in correct order
                start_idx = cycle.index(current)
                cycle = cycle[start_idx:] + cycle[:start_idx]

                return cycle

    return None

# Example usage
exchange_rates = {
    'USD-EUR': 0.85,
    'EUR-GBP': 0.9,
    'GBP-JPY': 155.0,
    'JPY-USD': 0.0092,
    'USD-JPY': 110.0,
    'EUR-USD': 1.18,
    'GBP-USD': 1.3
}

arbitrage_path = detect_arbitrage(exchange_rates)
if arbitrage_path:
    print(f"Arbitrage opportunity found: {' -> '.join(arbitrage_path)}")

    # Calculate profit from the cycle
    profit = 1.0
    for i in range(len(arbitrage_path) - 1):
        base = arbitrage_path[i]
        quote = arbitrage_path[i+1]
        rate_key = f"{base}-{quote}"
        if rate_key in exchange_rates:
            profit *= exchange_rates[rate_key]
        else:
            # If direct rate not available, use inverse
            inverse_key = f"{quote}-{base}"
            profit *= (1.0 / exchange_rates[inverse_key])

    print(f"Starting with 1 {arbitrage_path[0]}, you end with {profit} {arbitrage_path[0]}")
    print(f"Profit percentage: {(profit - 1) * 100:.2f}%")
else:
    print("No arbitrage opportunity found")
```

This yields negative profit ...

## 2. Portfolio Optimization with Transaction Costs

Here's an example of using Bellman-Ford to find the most cost-efficient way to rebalance a portfolio when considering transaction costs:

Each of these examples demonstrates how the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be effectively applied to different financial problems. The algorithm's ability to handle negative weights and detect negative cycles makes it particularly valuable in financial applications where finding arbitrage opportunities or optimal trading paths is critical.
